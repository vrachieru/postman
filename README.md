    Postman collections for various APIs.
</p>


This repository holds a series of Postman collections demonstrating a variety of use cases for different service APIs and are updated in sync with changes to the respective APIs.  

These examples have been created for use with the **Postman** utility. Postman is a testing framework for REST APIs. The tool can be downloaded from www.getpostman.com.  


## Install

To import these collections, first `clone` this repository, then open the Postman utility and select the *`Import`* option. Select the *`Folder`* tab from the dialog and drag and drop the cloned repository folder into the target.  

> **NOTE:** In order to get the postman requests to work, you **must** provide values for all defined variables within the collection. Within Postman, set the variables using the *`Manage environments`* menu.
